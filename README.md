# Operating System scheduling
### Run only when receiving the following four inputs from the user: input file, output file, time quantum (RR), and priority aging.
### The format of the input data should be in the order: 'pid priority arrival_time burst_time' (time units are in milliseconds)


## 1. FCFS scheduling
### Processed in order of arrival

## 2. Round-Robin scheduling
### Process by slicing according to the received time quantum
